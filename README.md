2 E-COMMERCE COMPANY  
An e-commerce company has a monolithic application that handles web and mobile clients, 
payment processing, order management, inventory, etc. But it has become bloated, fragile, 
and difficult to scale. Customer data is fragmented, limiting the ability to deliver 
personalized experiences. Adding new third-party services is also challenging. 
The monolithic structure makes it extremely difficult to implement new features quickly. 
For example, supporting a new payment provider requires invasive changes across the 
entire codebase. The lack of isolated customer data also restricts the e-commerce 
company's ability to tailor content and offers based on individual interests. The company 
needs a more agile architecture aligned to business capabilities to accelerate feature 
development and leverage data for personalization. 
The solution should take a microservices approach, decomposing the monolith into focused 
services by business capability. These services can expose their data through well-defined 
APIs managed by a gateway. A cloud data platform can aggregate data for analytics and 
machine learning. The focus should be on incrementally transitioning from the monolith to 
loosely coupled microservices oriented around domains. There are some specifications: 
▪ Break apart monolith into separate microservices for order management, payment 
processing, inventory etc. 
▪ Implement APIs for each microservice managed through a gateway. 
▪ Expose customer and product data via unified APIs. 
▪ Store consolidated data in a cloud data warehouse. 
▪ Leverage analytics and machine learning on harmonized data
